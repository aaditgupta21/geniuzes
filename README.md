Review binary | Binary Numbers
What binary numbers are and how they are used
All the media that we see in modern devices are made from millions of simple on/off switches
1. Prefix “dec” means 10
2. Biplane, binoculars, bicycle all have in common the prefix “bi”=2. Binary system uses only 2 numbers
3. Symbol on most power switches is a symbol with both 1 and 0

Bit is either a 1 or 0(on or off)
Digits 1 and 0 in binary represent the electrical signal being on and off
